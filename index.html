                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                

                <p>Looking back, there was one project in particular for a large film processing lab that did help in finding additional contracting work. It wasn’t the first project, it may have been the 5th or 6th. The project had a really short delivery time and integrated several technologies. The heart of the system hadn’t been tried before and was to rely on a custom made digital actuator. My part of the work involved writing 8080 assembly language code for editing and generating tapes for running the system. The project itself was an industrial real time control system to convert 35mm film into a format that would maximise the picture size by shifting a gimbaled lens back and forth across the film to follow the “action”. Why do that ? The system’s purpose was to resize older 35mm films to be viewed on NTSC/PAL TV broadcasts.

                    There were 2 programs to write: An editing program to enter a beginning and ending time with a list of positions to be moved to. The output was a paper tape to be feed into the industrial control electronics to move the lens in time with the film passing by. The process speed was such that calculating the ramp up/down gimbal positions in real time was impossible. The solution I came up with was to precalculate all moves in the editing station, and punch the tape with the gimbal setpoints as a list.
                    
                    In about 5 weeks the first iteration was done and debugged. Special test reels were used and the desired output was a “Pan-Scanned” medium that the customer was happy with.
                    
                    What made this project different was integrating a lot of experimental hardware and software into a working product with a short deadline. Many of the jobs at that time had not been built with a microprocessor as its core. The system was widely used for several years. Here then was a microprocessor based project that I could point to while being interviewed for industrial control contract work and the interviewer may have seen movies it had been used on. That resulted in several years of referral business with other film, sound and post-production outfits</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>One project that significantly impacted my tech career was developing a scalable backend system using Node.js and MongoDB. This project not only honed my skills in server-side development but also taught me the importance of performance optimization and efficient database management. It was a challenging experience that expanded my problem-solving abilities and deepened my understanding of full-stack development. Working on this project helped me gain confidence and opened doors to more complex and rewarding opportunities in my career.</p>

                <h3>Project 3</h3>
                <p>The last project I worked on was creating a website for a small business. The website included a homepage, a shop page, a contact page, and a blog page. I designed the website using WordPress and applied various plugins to add features such as a contact form, image galleries, and a blog section. I also optimized the website for SEO and integrated Google Analytics tracking.</p>
